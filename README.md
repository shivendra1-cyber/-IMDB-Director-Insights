IMDB, the world's most popular and authoritative source for movie, TV, and celebrity content, wants to provide more insights to its users about directors. Specifically, they want to offer users the ability to discover top-rated directors, their filmography, and other important details such as their awards and nominations.

To increase engagement on the platform by encouraging users to explore director-related content.
To establish IMDB as the go-to source for movie and TV-related information.
ðŸ“ˆ Proposed Solution:
To achieve the business goals, we propose building a Director Insights feature on the IMDB platform. The feature would allow users to search for directors and view their filmography, ratings, and other important information. The feature would also allow users to discover top
some of the relevant questions that can be addressed using the IMDB movie database:

Who are the top-rated directors based on the average ratings of their movies?
Which directors have the most movies in the IMDB database?
Is there a correlation between a movie's budget and its revenue?
